# Movie Rentals

This is (was) an ES2105 port of the (deliberately dodgy) example code in Martin Fowler's ["Refactoring"](https://www.martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html). 

Run `npm start` to run the app and `npm test` to run the tests.

I used it as a basis for discussion in technical interviews. The code works. But ... there are many code smells and plenty of scope for improvement. Good developers always have plenty to say about it!
